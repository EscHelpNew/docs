[Golang Webhook Server Library](https://github.com/green-api/whatsapp-api-webhook-server-golang) for integration with
WhatsApp messenger via API of [green-api.com](https://green-api.com/en) service. To use the library you have to get a
registration token and an account ID in the [personal cabinet](https://console.green-api.com/). There is a free
developer account tariff plan.

#### API

You can find REST API documentation by [url](https://green-api.com/en/docs/api/). The library is a wrapper for REST API,
so the documentation at the above url applies to the library as well.

#### Authorization

To send a message or to execute some other Green API methods, you have to have the WhatsApp account in the phone
application to be authorized. To authorize your account please go to the [personal area](https://console.green-api.com/)
and scan a QR-code using the WhatsApp application.
