??? question "Problems with phone number"

     Make sure you are using a supported phone number. Unsupported phone numbers cannot be registered to WhatsApp. These include:
    
     * VoIP numbers

     * landline numbers (Note: Landline phone number can only be registered in WhatsApp Business app)

     * free access numbers (8-800)

     * rooms with paid incoming calls

     * Universal Access Numbers (UANs)

     * virtual numbers

??? question "Device problem"

    * Update mobile app

    * Install the latest available version of the Android/iOS operating system on your device.

    * Reboot your device


??? question "Connection problems"

    * Make sure you have disabled "Aviation mode"

    * Use mobile internet instead of Wi-Fi network.

    * Use VPN. When you request a code (call), it is sent to you from the nearest Meta server, depending on the legislation of your country, your Internet provider may block such a connection, so the code or call will not go through to you.
    You must use a VPN to obtain an authorization code.
