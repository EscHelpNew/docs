??? question "Make sure your number is not registered with WABA (WhatsApp Business API)"

    WhatsApp Messenger, WhatsApp Business are different applications, but WhatsApp Business API is a different technology. You will not be able to use the same phone number in WABA and apps, but you can switch between them. If the number is registered in WABA, you will not be able to install the application on this number.

??? question "Device problem"

    * Update mobile app

    * Install the latest available version of the Android/iOS operating system on your device.

    * Reboot your device


??? question "Connection problems"

    * Make sure you have disabled "Aviation mode"

    * Use mobile internet instead of Wi-Fi network.

    * Use VPN. When you request a code (call), it is sent to you from the nearest Meta server, depending on the legislation of your country, your Internet provider may block such a connection, so the code or call will not go through to you.
    You must use a VPN to obtain an authorization code.
