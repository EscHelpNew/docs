## 3. How often you can request for a ban removal {#003}
Unblocking can be requested only once, then you have to wait for a response from WhatsApp. If your number is blocked several times in a row, then you need to take a break for several days.
In case you were refused to remove the ban, you are advised to repeat the request no earlier than in a month.

## 4. In what cases the removal of the ban is denied {#004}
The refusal to remove the ban most often comes due to users' complaints about your account or when certain methods are used excessively without emulating user actions (for example, constantly checking for WhatsApp availability without sending messages).

## 5. If you don't receive a message on the accepted request {#005}
We have noticed that when sending unblock requests using mailboxes in the ru zone, popular mail services, most often no response letters from WhatsApp are received. In this case, try sending the request using another mailbox or change the domain name of the mailbox zone.
